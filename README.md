# Introduction
This econometrics project examines the factors influencing hog litter rates, an important aspect of pork production that directly affects total amount of pork available for processing as well as timing. 
The analysis explores how various economic variables contribute to changes in litter rate. 

As part of a creative component for my masterâ€™s program, this project employs econometric techniques, including ordinary least squares, two-stage least squares, and vector auto-regression, to 
identify and quantify the relationships between hog litter rates and variables such as feed-price ratios, wean price, pre-weaning mortality rates, unemployment, seasonality, and trend.
